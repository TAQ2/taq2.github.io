NICE TO HAVE
on the icons of the first secion the graph looks much smaller than the book
cta on landing page could just be an arrow at the bottom of the page
animate the landing tile with a canvas or rebass-like animation
highlight the navigation button when tile is visible (stash is available) - but then the contact page will never be highlighted
talk about extra curricular things?
animations of text
safari smooth scroll doesn't work

OTHER REPOS:
Tic tac toe - takes so long to load? and is not on this website
Who has the spotlight
    - timings changes with the dims of the screen
    - is the code good
monopoly calculator as a lab?
